# Startrly
## What We're Looking For

Feature | Feedback
--- | ---
**General** |
Small commits with meaningful commit messages | Could use more commits, but this was downplayed in presentation of project, so no biggie.
Answered comprehension questions | Yep!
**Code Requirements** |
Only limited changes to the HTML (classes added for selection) | Yes
Page normalized | Yes
CSS grid used for layout | Yes, used it for navigation bar layout.
Flexbox used for layout | Yes the majority of the layout used this aside from the navigation bar
Google font used | Yes added Work Sans
CSS pseudo selector used | Yes on the call to action button created in the second section
Background color | Backgrounds were changed/added for the startly banner under the navigation bar, and in the footer. 
DRY CSS code | Looks pretty DRY to me, or as much as CSS can be. It is well organized and easy to read and understand what the css id doing and wehere.
Appearance matches the image | Looks really good! There are bullets for the unordered list in the about section that dont need to be there.
**Overall** |
Nice job Jazz! Looks really good, the sizing and spacing is good. It resizes teally well, aside from the quotes, which resize fine, but get very smushed really quickly. Maybe some more spacing on the Startly banner under the navigation bar would be nice visually/spatially. Nice work!
